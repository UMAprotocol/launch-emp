# Stub Package for Launching a New EMP

The purpose of this repository/package is to make it easy to customize your covered call EMP deployment. Feel free to use this repository in place or fork and customize it.

## Install system dependencies

You will need to install nodejs (we recommend the latest stable version, nodejs v14, and `nvm` to manage node versions) and yarn.

Note: these additional dependencies are required -- you may or may not have them on your system already:

- `libudev`
- `libusb`

Example ubuntu installation command for additional deps:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

## Install packages

```bash
yarn
```

## Run the deployment script on a mainnet fork

It's a good idea to try out your deployment on a fork before running it on mainnet. This will allow you to run the
deployment in a forked environment and interact with it to ensure it works as expected.

Start ganache.

```bash
yarn ganache-fork your.node.url.io
```

In a separate terminal, run the deployment script (it defaults to using localhost:8545 as the ETH node, which is
desired in this case). Note: mnemonic is optional here -- without it, ganache will use its default pre-loaded account.

```bash
node index.js --gasprice 160 --mnemonic "your mnemonic (12 word seed phrase)" --priceFeedIdentifier UNIUSD --collateralAddress "0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984" --expirationTimestamp "1622498400" --syntheticName "UNI 45 Call [31 May 2021]" --syntheticSymbol "UNIc45-0531" --minSponsorTokens "25"
```

Now you should be able to use `localhost:8545` to interact with a forked version of mainnet (or kovan) where your
contract is deployed.

## Run the deployment script on mainnet or kovan

```bash
node index.js --gasprice 160 --mnemonic "your mnemonic (12 word seed phrase)" --priceFeedIdentifier UNIUSD --collateralAddress "0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984" --expirationTimestamp "1622498400" --syntheticName "UNI 45 Call [31 May 2021]" --syntheticSymbol "UNIc45-0531" --minSponsorTokens "25" --url "your node url"
```

After deployment, you will need to go to the covered call financial product library contract address on Etherscan to set the strike price. TODO: Add links and example.

## Customize the script

The script should be fairly easy to read and understand. It is recommended to keep the default `empParams`
and customize your construction parameters by passing the listed mandatory args. See [the script](./index.js)
for more details.

We encourage you to fork this repo and customize the script as you see fit!
